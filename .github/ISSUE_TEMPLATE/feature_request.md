**Briefly describe your usage of Stargate**
Do you use Stargate?  Is it your only DAW?  If not, roughly what percentage of your work is done in Stargate?  Have you read the user manual or watched the Youtube videos?  Briefly describe what kind of music do you make with Stargate, and how it integrates into your workflow.  We want to gauge your understanding of the software, and your level of interest in the project.  We are open to good ideas, regardless of who they come from.

**Does your proposal align with the core project design principles?**
Project principles are available here
[HERE](https://github.com/stargateaudio/stargate/docs/project_design_principles.md)

If not, provide a justification for why we should implement it anyway.  We listen to our users, but we have an obligation to the same users and future users to maintain a project vision and align new features to that vision, and not become a bloated, incoherent mess of random features glued together.

Reading that document is mandatory to contribute to the project, even to voice dissenting opinions.  If you clearly did not read the document first, your issue may be closed or deleted.

**Describe what you want to do**
NOT how you want to do it.  It should be high-level and generic to the greatest extent possible, for example:
- I want to record audio
- I want to split sequencer items
- I want to play a virtual analog synthesizer

After the high-level overview statement, you may provide additional detail and context below.

**OPTIONAL: Describe one or more ways you propose we can accomplish this**
Describe how this might look in practice.  Possibly provide multiple options.  It is OK if you are not sure, either way we will collaborate with you to design a final solution.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
