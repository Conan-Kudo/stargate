# Stargate
Stargate is a powerful suite of audio tools and a holistic audio production
solution.

# Current State
Pre-alpha.  Things will break.  Projects you create now will not work in future
versions.  If you still want to try it, you may test it and offer your input
and bug reports, but do not expect support.  This message will be updated
when the current release is considered stable.
